# rangers-127-project-wk3

Worked together on Car() and Parking() classes, switched drivers during process.

Nico: Worked on user input functionality, created while loops, payment functionality, and more.

Priscilla: I worked on the pseudo code and printing the “welcome” and “price” sections. I also worked on the return ticket, we worked on the basic functionality and layout of the project. We brainstormed on ideas for how to add a “self id” to each ticket/car that comes into the garage.
